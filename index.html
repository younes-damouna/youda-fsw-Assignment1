                <li>Vegetables and fruits are an important part of a healthy diet, and variety is as important as
                    quantity.</li>
                <li>No single fruit or vegetable provides all of the nutrients you need to be healthy. Eat plenty every
                    day.</li>

            <p>A diet rich in vegetables and fruits can lower blood pressure, reduce the risk of heart disease and
                stroke, prevent some types of cancer, lower risk of eye and digestive problems, and have a positive
                effect upon blood sugar, which can help keep appetite in check. Eating non-starchy vegetables and fruits
                like apples, pears, and green leafy vegetables may even promote weight loss. [1] Their low glycemic
                loads prevent blood sugar spikes that can increase hunger.

                At least nine different families of fruits and vegetables exist, each with potentially hundreds of
                different plant compounds that are beneficial to health. Eat a variety of types and colors of produce in
                order to give your body the mix of nutrients it needs. This not only ensures a greater diversity of
                beneficial plant chemicals but also creates eye-appealing meals.

                Tips to eat more vegetables and fruits each day </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Keep fruit where you can see it. Place several ready-to-eat washed whole fruits in a bowl or store chopped colorful fruits in a glass bowl in the refrigerator to tempt a sweet tooth.</li>
                <li>Explore the produce aisle and choose something new. Variety and color are key to a healthy diet. On most days, try to get at least one serving from each of the following categories: dark green leafy vegetables; yellow or orange fruits and vegetables; red fruits and vegetables; legumes (beans) and peas; and citrus fruits.</li>
                <li>Skip the potatoes. Choose other vegetables that are packed with different nutrients and more slowly digested carbohydrates.</li>
           <li>Make it a meal. Try cooking new recipes that include more vegetables. Salads, soups, and stir-fries are just a few ideas for increasing the number of tasty vegetables in your meals.</li>

                    Cardiovascular disease


                </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A meta-analysis of cohort studies following 469,551 participants found that a higher intake of fruits and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease, with an average reduction in risk of 4% for each additional serving per day of fruit and vegetables. [2]</li>
                    <li>The largest and longest study to date, done as part of the Harvard-based Nurses’ Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study, included almost 110,000 men and women whose health and dietary habits were followed for 14 years.</li>
                    <li>The higher the average daily intake of fruits and vegetables, the lower the chances of developing cardiovascular disease. Compared with those in the lowest category of fruit and vegetable intake (less than 1.5 servings a day), those who averaged 8 or more servings a day were 30% less likely to have had a heart attack or stroke. [3]</li>
                    <li>Although all fruits and vegetables likely contributed to this benefit, green leafy vegetables, such as lettuce, spinach, Swiss chard, and mustard greens, were most strongly associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease. Cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, bok choy, and kale; and citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, limes, and grapefruit (and their juices) also made important contributions. [3]</li>
                    <li>When researchers combined findings from the Harvard studies with several other long-term studies in the U.S. and Europe, and looked at coronary heart disease and stroke separately, they found a similar protective effect: Individuals who ate more than 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day had roughly a 20% lower risk of coronary heart disease [4] and stroke, [5] compared with individuals who ate less than 3 servings per day.</li>
